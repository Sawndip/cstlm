\subsection{Suffix Arrays and Suffix Trees}

Given a text {\col} of size {\collen} drawn from an alphabet {\alphabet} of
size {\alphabetsize}, the {\it suffix tree} of {\col} is the compact labeled
tree where the root to leaf paths corresponds to all suffixes of {\col}.

Overview with pretty picture. E.g., character level CSA / CST for 
'a quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog' or similar.

Including something on BWT \& self indexes.

Forward and backward search.

\subsection{Compressed Suffix Structures}

WT, nested brackets CST, rank/select etc. Wiener links even?
